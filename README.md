My name is Youssef el habchi, from [React Native Master](https://rn-master.com) I welcome each and everyone of you.




Hello everyone, welcome into this article where we are going make a React Native Modal Example, with simple and good looking UI.

This Modal example can be using in various ways to show a component above your usual content.

Or to receive action based feedback for users, such as accepting or allowing something.


Feel free to read the whole article on my blog [React Native Modal Example](https://rn-master.com/react-native-modal-example/)
If you would like to try the app on Expo, I have prepared an expo project, check it from  [Expo.io](https://expo.io/@alhydra/react-native-modal-example)
